# ANN - feed forward Propagation
Implementation and testing of a basic version of a Artificial Neural Networks feed forward Propagation in Python from scratch

**Dataset:**
- fixed targets ans inputs for the network

**Note:**
- 2 inputs, a first hidden layer with 3 nodes, a second hidden layer with 4 nodes and one output node
- use of random weights and biases
-  calculates the loss between the output of the network and the target
- runs it multiple times and writes down the weights and biases for the lowest loss
